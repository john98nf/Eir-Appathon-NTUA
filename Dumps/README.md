## Dumps folder
This folder contains all the necessary scripts for creating the mongo database from scratch. All the data (in xml & json format), database dumps and folders needed for this process, 
will be downloaded, created or extracted here automatically. Last but not least, it should be noticed that folders like `xml` and `json` (which will be created by `xml2json_converter.sh`) and archives like `AllPublicXML.zip` or `back-up.tar.gz` can be deleted if need be, after this process.
